### Introduction

>"The only appropriate food for the silkworm is the leaf of the mulberry tree. It should be the first business therefore of the silk grower to provide himself with the source of a constant supply of mulberry leaves."[^1]

Addressing the House of Representatives on Thursday, February 24, 1831, Mr. Abel Wheeler, Chairman of the Committee on Agriculture, reported that the power and wealth of France were mainly derived from silk production and that a number of other European countries had embarked on the same path "with zeal."[^2] Conversely, the United States was spending a fortune on foreign silk: between 1821 and 1825 the total value of imported silk was worth approximately $943,723,497 in today’s currency. To further his point, Mr. Wheeler compared this vast sum to the revenue generated from US bread exports: a paltry $5 million a year, or about $180 million today. Not only could mulberry leaves—the food of silkworms—be transformed into stacks of cash, but the mulberry tree itself was undemanding, requiring neither good soil nor good climate.

Despite investing years of effort however, Wheeler’s dream of turning leaves into gold came to nothing. By the fall of 1839, the demand for mulberry trees had collapsed and thousands of acres of white mulberry plantations across Virginia and Georgia lay abandoned, their planters now destitute.  Here we tell the story of loss, but also one of renewal and metamorphosis. In the shadows of the fields haunted by white mulberries rose the canopies of another tree: Morus rubra, the red mulberry native to North America. While its eastern relative, the white mulberry, has captured attention throughout history, both within and outside of its native ranges, the red mulberry has been overshadowed even in its home continent. Even though the red mulberry is found almost nowhere else in the world but North America, more often than not it is the white mulberry that comes to mind when we think of a mulberry tree.
